Dear Sirs ro Madams,

I have just gradeated from skool and want to work for your prestige company.  My programming skeels are hte best of anyone in my klass.  If you hire me yool be able to fire most of the other programmers becuse I can do the work of ten poeple.  My best work was in my CS 1410 teached by Dr. Qi wen I wrote a program to do speel checking.

Sinly,

Micah Joker
